- My project is a dental web app. 
- I have been working at a community dental clinic for 3 years and would like to create this project for a “fiction” client. 
- This project will allow patients to have access to useful information and easily make an appointment by using a form on the contact page. 
- The features that I have created are forms submitted that will send data to the database. A feature I would like to add is the chatbot feature. 
- Connecting the web app with the database by PHP using Azure cloud was challenging. The web app running well and all pages are linked. 
- The database is getting data from the web app. PHP language, Azure Cloud Server, and Database Workbench are the most interesting and helpful to me. These tools allow me to practice how to publish a project online consistently.
