- This project is a dental web app. 
- Creating this project for a “fiction” client. 
- The project will allow patients to have access to useful information and easily make an appointment by using a form on the contact page. 
- The features were created are forms submitted that will send data to the database. A future feature is the chatbot. 
- Connecting the web app with the database by PHP using Azure cloud. The web app running well and all pages are linked. 
- The database is getting data from the web app. 
- Tools: HTML/CSS, PHP, MySQL, Azure Cloud Server.
- PHP, Azure Cloud Server, and Database Workbench are the most interesting and helpful to me. These tools allow me to practice how to publish a project online consistently.
